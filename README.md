# CFP Tracker

This application allows conference speakers to track conferences and their 
Calls for Papers (CfPs). Events can be created by anyone, and then individual 
users can "track" events to see what's coming up, when they need to submit by,
and get notifications about events coming up soon. This applicaiton is not
intended to be used by regular conference attendees.
